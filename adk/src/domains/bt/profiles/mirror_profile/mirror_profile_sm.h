/*! \brief Mirror Profile States

    The main states of a mirror profile link depend on the previous state.
    For example, a mirror eSCO connection must first have the peer earbud
    connected and a mirror ACL link to the earbud before it can be created.

    The state enum values below represent this by using bitmasks to group
    states based on whether the peer is disconnected, mirror ACL is connected,
    and finally if mirror eSCO or mirror A2DP is connected.

    Mirror eSCO and mirror A2DP are mutually exclusive operations.

    Transition States:
    The state machine has stable and transition states. A transition state is
    one where it is waiting for a reply from the firmware only. Other
    messages should be blocked until the reply has been received.

    A stable state is one where it is ok to process messages from any origin,
    e.g. internal messages (see #mirror_profile_internal_msg_t).

    The transition lock is set when going into a transition state. Any
    internal messages should be sent conditional on this lock.

    Stable states
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_DISCONNECTED
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_ACL_CONNECTED
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_ESCO_CONNECTED
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_A2DP_CONNECTED
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_CIS_CONNECTED

    Transition states
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_ACL_CONNECTING
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_ESCO_CONNECTING
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_ACL_DISCONNECTING
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_ESCO_DISCONNECTING
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_A2DP_DISCONNECTING
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_CIS_CONNECTING
    * MIRROR_PROFILE_STATE_CIS_DISCONNECTING

    \note The stable states are also the main sub-states of the state machine.


    Pseudo States:
    The state machine has a concept of pseudo-states that group together states
    to represent a sub-state of the overall state machine. In the enum below
    the pseudo-states are marked by the top 4 bits in the first byte of the
    enum value.

    The pseudo-states are:
    ACL_CONNECTED       (MIRROR_PROFILE_SUB_STATE_ACL_CONNECTED)
    ESCO_CONNECTED      (MIRROR_PROFILE_SUB_STATE_ESCO_CONNECTED | ACL_CONNECTED)
    A2DP_CONNECTED      (MIRROR_PROFILE_SUB_STATE_A2DP_CONNECTED | ACL_CONNECTED)
    CIS_CONNECTED       (MIRROR_PROFILE_SUB_STATE_CIS_CONNECTED)

    These are mainly used for testing what the sub-state is when the state
    machine is in a transition state.

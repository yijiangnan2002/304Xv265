    \note The Case comms protocol detects some types of sequence number failure
          modes and sends a broadcast message to reset the transport. This also
          flushes any queued messages on both Case and Earbuds.
          
          If no callback is registered, case comms will use an empty broadcast
          message, which just resets the transport sequence numbers but provides
          no additional information to the Earbuds.

          Clients can register a function to generate a broadcast message with
          content to piggyback on the broadcast reset. Broadcast messages are
          received by both earbuds. Client reset function must call
          CcProtocol_Transmit() with destination of CASECOMMS_DEVICE_BROADCAST.
          No return value is required. See ccProtocol_TransmitBroadcastReset()
          for an example.

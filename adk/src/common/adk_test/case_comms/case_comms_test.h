\brief      Interface to case comms testing functions

This component provides an API for test scripts to exercise the case comms protocol
functionality provided by the cc_protocol component in the case_comms domain.

Scripts must call CaseCommsTest_Init() before using any other API, this registers this
component as the user of the CASECOMMS_CID_TEST case comms channel.

After completion of tests using this API the DUT should be rebooted, no provision
is made to free allocated memory or unregister the test channel with case comms.

To transmit a message:
    - Call CaseCommsTest_TxMsg()
        - Check return value that message has been accepted for transmission
    - Poll CaseCommsTest_PollTxStatus() to check status of transmitted message
        - will initially return CASECOMMS_STATUS_UNKNOWN which should then change
          to a status indicating result of the transmission, for example
          CASECOMMS_TX_SUCCESS where message acknowledged. However, the test script
          could setup a failure scenario and test for an expected CASECOMMS_TX_FAIL
          status.

To receive a message...
    - Poll CaseCommsTest_PollRxMsgLen()
        - will initially return 0, but will return non-zero value when message is
          received
    - Allocate memory of size returned by CaseCommsTest_PollRxMsgLen()
    - Call CaseCommsTest_RxMsg() passing pointer to allocated memory to retrieve
      the received message.

The implementation is currently very simple, no protection is provided against
overwriting of a previous message with a new one. As such it is currently suited
to simple interactions, but not yet for high-throughput and/or queued messaging.

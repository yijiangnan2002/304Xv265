@file   upgrade.h
@brief  Header file for the Upgrade library

        Interface to the Upgrade library which provides support for upgrading
        CSR device software, using the VM Upgrade mechanism.

        The library exposes a functional downstream API and an upstream message
        based API.

        See @ref otau_library

@page   otau_library Upgrade library integration

This page provides a summary of how the upgrade library upgrade.h
integrates with applications.

@section sec_basic Basics

To make use of the upgrade library, all of the following are needed.

Examples of all of these can be found in the example Sink application
supplied with the ADK. See @ref sec_sinkapp for a summary of the upgrade
library integration.
        @li @ref subsec_defparset
        @li @ref subsec_tranmech
        @li @ref subsec_libinit
        @li @ref subsec_libint
        @li @ref subsec_permit
        @li @ref subsec_host

@subsection subsec_defparset Partition set

The library uses the concept of logical partitions to define what is being
upgraded. Apart from a partition used for DFU operations these must be
paired, such that there is an active partition and a partition available for
upgrade.

The unused partitions will be kept erased.

@subsection subsec_tranmech Transport mechanism
@subsection subsec_libinit Library initialisation
@subsection subsec_libint Library integration
@subsection subsec_permit Permitting activities
@subsection subsec_host A host applications

@section sec_sinkapp Supplied Sink application

The Sink application supplied as an example makes use of the upgrade
library through the gaia library (gaia.h).

    Upgrade library will respond with #UPGRADE_INIT_CFM_T message, the library

    The initialisation informs the upgrade library of the partitions that
    may be upgraded. Only partitions referenced here can be upgraded.

    If your application uses upgradable raw serial (RS) partitions then you
    should not make any assumptions about the active partition, instead call
    the function @ref UpgradeGetPartitionInUse to retrieve the currently
    active partition ID.

    The upgrade library must be initialised with an "enabled" permission of
    either #upgrade_perm_assume_yes or #upgrade_perm_always_ask. If the
    application wishes to disable upgrades it must call #UpgradePermit() with
    the #upgrade_perm_no parameter, after successful initalisation.

    The upgrade library may reject an attempt by the VM application to disable

    * Rebooting the device as part of completing an upgrade
    * Blocking the system to erase serial flash partition, may effect audio.

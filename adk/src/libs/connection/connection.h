    \brief Register a scanner and filter rules to be used.

    A scanner has to be configured with filter rules.  It is designed to only
    report what a user requires so limiting unwanted data.  To do this it has 2
    stages of filtering:

    adv_filter - Used to match types of advertising reports like:
        advertising data that belongs to extended advertising
        advertising data that has the limited discovery flag set.
        etc...
    ad_structure_filter -   Used to drill into the ad_structure data to look for
                            particular ad_types or combinations of ad_types like:
        Only report the AD Structure data for the ad_types registered
        in reg_ad_types.
        Only report the AD Structure data for the ad_types registered in reg_ad_types
        and if all ad_types registered are in the advertising report.
        etc...

    The adv_filter will be applied first and will throw away any extended
    adverting reports that do not meet this filter.  The ad_structure_filter
    will be applied next.  The extended advertising report will be thrown away
    if no ad_types of interest are found. Else this report will be sent as a
    DM_ULP_EXT_SCAN_FILTERED_ADV_REPORT_IND with the AD Type Structures of
    interest in a MBLK chain.

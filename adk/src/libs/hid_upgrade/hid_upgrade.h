/**
 * @file hid_upgrade.h
 * @brief Header file for HID USB Upgrade.
 *
 * @page hid_upgrade USB HID report handling for the upgrade transport.
 *
 * @section Incoming (from host) reports
 * @subsection Set Reports
 *
 * The following set reports are handled by this transport:
 *  - HID_REPORTID_UPGRADE_DATA_TRANSFER (5)
 *  - HID_REPORTID_COMMAND               (3)
 *
 * The HID_REPORTID_CONTROL (4) report is not handled as the functionality it
 * provides is not required or is duplicated by HID_REPORTID_COMMAND.
 *
 * HID_REPORTID_DATA_TRANSFER
 * The data and data size provided in this report are passed to
 * UpgradeProcessDataRequest (note: the data is buffered first).
 *
 * HID_REPORTID_COMMAND
 * The associated data contains a 2 octet 'command'. The supported values for
 * this command are:
 *  - HID_CMD_CONNECTION_REQ (2) - Calls UpgradeTransportConnectRequest
 *  - HID_CMD_DISCONNECT_REQ (7) - Calls UpgradeTransportDisconnectRequest
 *
 * Other commands are not supported.
 *
 * @subsection Get Reports
 *
 * No get reports are handled by this transport.
 *
 * @section Outgoing (to host) messages
 *
 * After connection, data will be sent to the host from this transport via calls
 * to the handler passed to HidUpgradeRegisterInputReportCb(). These will have
 * the report ID HID_REPORTID_UPGRADE_RESPONSE (6). The data size is passed
 * along with the report and will be a maximum length of 12 octets.
 *
 * UPGRADE_TRANSPORT_DATA_IND will send a response report containing a data
 * packet.
 *
 * UPGRADE_TRANSPORT_DATA_CFM does not send any response.
 *
 * UPGRADE_TRANSPORT_CONNECT_CFM will send a response report containing the
 * upgrade_status_t status.
 *
 * UPGRADE_TRANSPORT_DISCONNECT_CFM does not send any response.
